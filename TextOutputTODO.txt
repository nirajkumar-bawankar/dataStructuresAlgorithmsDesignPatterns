TO-DO LIST

1. Attempt first to insert into BST, then to bintree.
	If name is not in the BST, and the coordinate is not a duplicate:
		0 add -105.7 -24.3 Riley
		Riley -105.7 -24.3 is added to the BST
		Riley -105.7 -24.3 is added to the bintree
	If name appears:
		1 add 21.2 -38.6 Taylor
			Riley -105.7 -24.3 is added to the BST
			Riley -105.7 -24.3 is added to the bintree
		1 add 21.2 -38.6 Taylor
			Taylor duplicates a watcher already in the BST.
	If name doesn't appear, but coordinate is a duplicate:
		0 add -105.7 -24.3 Riley
			Riley -105.7 -24.3 is added to the BST
			Riley -105.7 -24.3 is added to the bintree
		8 add -105.7 -24.3 Sean
			Sean -105.7 -24.3 is added to the BST
			-105.7 -24.3 duplicates a watcher already in the bintree
			Sean is removed from the BST
2. Removing a watcher.
	If watcher exists:
		1 add 21.2 -38.6 Taylor
		8 delete Taylor 
		Taylor 21.2 -38.6 is removed from the BST
		Taylor 21.2 -38.6 is removed from the bintree
	If watcher does not exist.
		21 delete Notexist
		Notexist does not appear in the BST

3. Implement "debug" command.
	Output current state of BST
	Output current stage of Bintree
		preorder traversal:
			Internal nodes = I
			Empty Nodes = E
			Data points = Output name and coordinates of point's position
